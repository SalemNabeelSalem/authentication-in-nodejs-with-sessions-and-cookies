# Authentication in Nodejs with Sessions and Cookies
Refactored and Cleaned Code for Understanding Authentication in Node.js using Sessions and Cookies.

In this project, I kept things simple and hammered in the concepts behind using Sessions and Cookies for Authentication.

To use this code do the following:
1. Clone this repo or download it.
2. Navigate into the location you downloaded folder in your cmd/bash/terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install all the depends in this projects (bcryptjs, config, connect-mongodb-session, ejs, express, express-session and mongoose).
4. Check inside of the config folder under the default.json for the mongodb URI and insert your own connection string.
